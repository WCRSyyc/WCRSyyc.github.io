# TI-84 graphing calculator

This page provides a few links to some of the better discovered places to learn more about using the Texas Instruments graphic calculator.  This is not a full list, or even the best places.  Just places to start, if you do not have something better.  These have been at least glanced at, and seem to be informative and useful without needing an particular background.

Warning: There are 2 minus `-` keys on the keyboard.  They are not interchangeable.  Use the one at the bottom, shows as `(-)`, when entering negative values (versus doing subtraction)
